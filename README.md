## Classic Slot Java Game
Just a little side project I made during my ITBootcamp Software QA course (along with [Bingo Slot Game](https://github.com/DamjanQA/BINGO-Slot-Java-Game)) using the awt and swing graphics library. The aim of the project was for me to practice Java and create the logic behind a simple slot game from scratch.

(**Note:** Work in progress! Tho, the first version is already playable!) 

## Installation
Open terminal in IDE and git clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/DamjanQA/Classic-Slot-Java-Game.git
```

## How To Play
1. Run App in your IDE
2. Click the "Spin to Win" button to try your luck
3. Each spin costs $1 and getting 3 of the same awards you $20
4. Upon Game Over restart the App
