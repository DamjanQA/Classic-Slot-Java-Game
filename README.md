## Classic Slot Java Game
Just a little side project I made during my ITBootcamp Software QA course (along with [Bingo Slot Game](https://github.com/DamjanQA/BINGO-Slot-Java-Game)) using the awt and swing graphics library. The aim of the project was for me to practice Java and create the logic behind a simple slot game from scratch.

(Playable but still a work in progress...)
